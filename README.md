# 353_Project

## Objectives

1) - To Prove that a movies plot summary has no relation whatsover with the critic ratings or there is no such 'faviourite' genres that critic's like

2) - To predict a movie's genres using plot summary with the help of nltk packages.

## Technical Details

The code is written in Python 3.6 version. To setup the environment with all required dependencies you must have first jupyter-notebook via terminal or using Anaconda cloud. Also pip3 must be installed in the command line to install the packages

```javascript
pip3 install pandas
pip3 install matplotlib
pip3 install sklearn
pip3 install seaborn
pip3 install nltk
pip3 install spacy
python3 -m spacy download en_core_web_sm
```

## Usage

To execute the python3 code, clone this repository and go inside this directory and write:
```javacript
python3 nlp.py
```

## Reading Output

The code outputs model scores, but further more exploration you can load the .ipynb file which is inside Jupyter-Notebook called kernel.ipynb for easier access.

## Additional Information
I have also added the data, so for further more explorations you can take a look into it.
